# tsv.py: a module for writing TSV (tab-separated value) files
"""
This module defines two classes: a TsvWriter, which can be constructed on a
stream to allow writing TSV data lines and #-delimited comments to that stream,
and a TsvReader, which can be constructed on a stream and iterated over to
obtain lists of the values from each non-comment line in the stream.

TSV is most useful as the basis for other, more tightly specified file formats.
